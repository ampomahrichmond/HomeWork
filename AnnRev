Major Accomplishments

JIRA Comparator & Collibra SQL Translator
This year, I developed tools that solved very real challenges for our team. The JIRA Comparator provided a much-needed way to handle project migrations with less friction, while the Collibra SQL Translator helped transform raw SQL into Collibra-ready SQL. These weren’t just technical wins—they made our work easier and more efficient, saving time and cutting down on errors.

TARGET RISE Report
When I first took over the team, this report had been broken for two years. Getting it fixed in my first month wasn’t just a technical achievement—it was about restoring trust and reliability for the business partners who rely on it. This was a proud early milestone that set the tone for the rest of the year.

TDAF and Data Lineage
I partnered with my team to successfully recreate the TDAF report after enterprise feed updates, ensuring consistency in reporting. Early in the year, I also helped resolve a key Data Lineage issue for AOF, closing out that engagement in a way that gave the business confidence in our data flows.

Audit Standards and Support
One of the areas I’m most proud of is the work to establish new audit standards where none existed before. From peer reviews and quarterly attestations to AD group access controls and monthly workflow reviews, these processes didn’t just pass an audit—they gave the team structure and sustainability for years to come. Leading my team through 8 walkthroughs with auditors required patience, preparation, and a lot of clear communication. It stretched me, but it also demonstrated the value we bring when we combine technical skill with process discipline.

AZ Group Ownership
Taking on AZ ownership during a period of transition was a major responsibility. With the team shrinking, I had to step in and ensure documentation, access controls, and daily rules were put in place. It wasn’t easy, but it allowed us to provide continuity for stakeholders and keep critical processes running.

People and Team Contributions
I’m also proud of the human side of this year—hiring two strong candidates who are already making a difference, and leading a team that completed over 290 JIRA requests (plus countless quick-turnaround tasks). This work was done while managing through organizational changes and departures, which required not only effort but resilience.

Collibra and CDQ Expansion
Lastly, I supported the TBSM MOU work and led a small team to review CDQ and Data Compass. These steps set us up for the future state of having all our rules in CDQ, moving us further along in building a more mature data quality environment.

Challenges and Lessons Learned

This year was not without challenges. The splitting of teams created confusion at times, and while the intent of the transition was clear, the execution could have been smoother. Team capacity also became a recurring issue, with departures and a reduced workforce stretching us thin. Despite this, we managed to deliver, but it reinforced for me how important preparation, tools, and teamwork are in navigating change.

I’ve learned that leadership in these moments isn’t just about delivering work—it’s about helping people stay focused, finding clarity in ambiguity, and making sure the team feels supported even when the circumstances are difficult.

Personal Growth

I’ve made it a priority to keep growing as a leader. This year, I leaned into developing stronger business knowledge, engaging more with executives, and ensuring my team had clarity and purpose through change. I’ve also become more comfortable navigating the “gray areas” where there isn’t always a right answer, but a thoughtful decision is still needed.

Looking ahead, I want to deepen my skill set in AI and applied technologies. Agentic and applied AI are areas I believe will directly benefit our team and the broader organization, and I want to be prepared to lead in that space.

Closing Reflection

This year has been a mix of building, fixing, and leading through transitions. Some of the work was visible (reports, tools, audits), but much of it was about keeping people and processes steady when things could have fallen apart. I’m proud of the resilience my team and I showed, and I feel that I’ve grown both technically and as a leader.

For me, this wasn’t just about delivering results—it was about ensuring that the people relying on us could continue to trust that their work would move forward. And while there’s still more to do, I feel confident that we’ve laid a stronger foundation for the years ahead.
