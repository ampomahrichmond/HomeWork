1. Data Testing & Transaction Testing

Walk me through how you would design an end-to-end data testing framework for transaction-level data in a banking environment.

What are the key differences between substantive testing, control testing, and automated QA/QC testing? Provide examples from your experience.

How would you validate large transactional datasets across multiple source systems to ensure accuracy and completeness? What tools or scripts would you use?

Explain a situation where you found systemic errors in transaction testing. How did you detect them, and what was the remediation process?

How do you incorporate negative testing and edge-case scenarios in financial data testing?

2. Data Quality & Controls

How would you implement data quality rules (e.g., for critical data elements in a bank) and measure their effectiveness?

Describe a time you found a material data quality issue during testing. How did you quantify its impact, and what actions did you take?

What is the difference between first line of defense QA/QC testing vs. second line assurance in data management?

How do you ensure traceability and lineage of data during QA and control testing? Have you used tools like Collibra for this purpose?

What metrics (KPIs) do you track to monitor data control effectiveness?

3. Risk Management & Audit

How would you design a risk-based testing approach for a new banking product rollout?

What are the most common data risk scenarios in banking, and how do you mitigate them?

Explain how you would prepare for an internal audit review of data testing activities. What artifacts would you produce?

Describe your experience integrating risk management technology into QA processes.

How do you link operational risk incidents to your testing results to ensure risk coverage?

4. Technical (SQL, Python, Automation)

Write a SQL query to identify transactions where the sum of credits does not equal the sum of debits within a ledger table. How would you optimize it for performance?

How would you use Python to automate a daily data validation process across multiple data sources (e.g., CSV, API, Database)?

Explain how you have implemented automated controls using scripts or tools. What challenges did you face?

How do you handle schema changes in automated test scripts for banking systems?

What techniques do you use to ensure accuracy and scalability in large-volume data testing (billions of records)?

5. Banking QA & Compliance

How do you test for regulatory compliance (e.g., SOX, BCBS 239, GDPR) within data testing frameworks?

Give an example where you identified a compliance breach via QA testing. How did you escalate and resolve it?

What role do reconciliations play in financial data QA, and how do you automate them?

Describe how you approach end-to-end testing in a core banking migration project.

6. Team Management (Offshore/Onshore)

How do you structure and manage an offshore QA team to ensure high-quality deliverables?

What metrics do you use to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of remote teams?

How do you ensure knowledge transfer and continuity between onshore and offshore testers?

Describe a time you had to resolve conflicts or quality issues with an offshore team.

7. Scenario-Based Case Study

You are leading data QA for a new payment processing system. During UAT, you find 5% of transactions failing validation due to mismatched reference data from an upstream system. Walk me through how you would handle this issueâ€”root cause analysis, stakeholder communication, and remediation plan.
