DQ Rule Change Management Process
Formal Initiation and Requirements Definition:

Change requests for new or updated Data Quality (DQ) rules are formally submitted and tracked via JIRA, including detailed business requirements and specifications.

Development and Configuration:

The Automation Team develops the rule logic and workflow configuration using approved tools, specifically SQL and Alteryx.

Development is performed in a non-production environment to maintain system integrity.

Independent Technical Peer Review:

Before testing, a technical peer review is conducted by an independent member of the Automation Team. This review verifies the technical accuracy and adherence of the rule logic and Alteryx workflows to the documented requirements.

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and Validation:

The developed rule output is provided to the business Requestor for independent validation.

The Requestor performs User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to confirm the results meet the defined business specifications and requirements.

Formal Approval and Sign-off:

Upon successful UAT, the Requestor formally approves the change, providing documented sign-off for the rule update or creation to be moved to the production environment. This step ensures proper Segregation of Duties between development and approval.

Deployment to Production:

Following mandatory approvals, the Automation Team manages the deployment of the validated rule logic and associated changes into the production environment.

The Requestor is formally notified upon successful implementation.

Traceability and Documentation:

The JIRA ticket serves as the audit trail, documenting all stages from initial request through technical review, UAT, final approval, and production implementation, before being marked as Completed.





Business Justification for New Hire: [Role Title]
This request seeks urgent approval to backfill the [Role Title] position, which is critical for maintaining operational continuity and workload balance following the departure of [Former Employee Name]. This role is essential for supporting key organizational functions, and a delay in filling it would create an immediate capacity gap, leading to inevitable delays in core process management and an unsustainable increase in responsibilities for the remaining team members. Prompt approval is required to mitigate operational risk and prevent a decline in service delivery across various data and technology initiatives.

More critically, this hire is a strategic necessity to accelerate our high-priority organizational initiatives, particularly in the areas of digital transformation and data intelligence. We require a candidate with specialized technical expertise to support ongoing efforts in Automation, AI/Machine Learning, and robust Data Quality (DQ) management. Specific proficiency in tools and languages like Collibra for data governance and Python for advanced scripting and development is non-negotiable. This hire is not merely a replacement; it is an investment that directly enables our progress toward realizing significant efficiency gains and strategic objectives in the coming year.
