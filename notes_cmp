DQ Rule Change Management Process
Formal Initiation and Requirements Definition:

Change requests for new or updated Data Quality (DQ) rules are formally submitted and tracked via JIRA, including detailed business requirements and specifications.

Development and Configuration:

The Automation Team develops the rule logic and workflow configuration using approved tools, specifically SQL and Alteryx.

Development is performed in a non-production environment to maintain system integrity.

Independent Technical Peer Review:

Before testing, a technical peer review is conducted by an independent member of the Automation Team. This review verifies the technical accuracy and adherence of the rule logic and Alteryx workflows to the documented requirements.

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and Validation:

The developed rule output is provided to the business Requestor for independent validation.

The Requestor performs User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to confirm the results meet the defined business specifications and requirements.

Formal Approval and Sign-off:

Upon successful UAT, the Requestor formally approves the change, providing documented sign-off for the rule update or creation to be moved to the production environment. This step ensures proper Segregation of Duties between development and approval.

Deployment to Production:

Following mandatory approvals, the Automation Team manages the deployment of the validated rule logic and associated changes into the production environment.

The Requestor is formally notified upon successful implementation.

Traceability and Documentation:

The JIRA ticket serves as the audit trail, documenting all stages from initial request through technical review, UAT, final approval, and production implementation, before being marked as Completed.





Business Justification for New Hire: [Role Title]
This request seeks urgent approval to backfill the [Role Title] position, which is critical for maintaining operational continuity and workload balance following the departure of [Former Employee Name].

1. Access Listing and Scope Definition
Request Initiation: Initiate a formal request with IT Security (via ServiceNow) to procure a complete list of all users currently holding access to the Active Directory (AD) group associated with the Alteryx workflow network drives.

Documentation: The generated list serves as the official scope document for the attestation cycle.

2. Attestation Review and Assignment
AD Group Reconciliation: The Automation/DQ Team reviews the provided user list against the current AD group membership to ensure accuracy and confirm the individuals requiring attestation.

Management Accountability: Access lists are segmented and formally distributed to the respective People Managers via an auditable communication channel (e.g., email).

Goal: To establish accountability for each user's continued access needs.

3. Formal Manager Confirmation
Required Action: People Managers are required to formally respond, confirming one of two actions for each of their listed associates:

Continued Access: Confirmation that the user still requires access for their current role and responsibilities.

Access Removal: Confirmation that the user no longer requires access (e.g., due to role change, termination, or transfer).

Deadline Enforcement: A defined deadline is established and communicated to ensure timely completion of the review.

4. Remediation and Access Revocation
Consolidation: All formal responses are compiled by the Automation/DQ Team to identify users confirmed for removal.

Change Request: A formal, documented request is submitted (e.g., via a new ServiceNow ticket) to IT Security or the designated team to immediately revoke the network drive access for all users designated for removal.

Verification: The team verifies the removal confirmation to ensure the principle of Least Privilege is maintained.

5. Final Documentation and Audit Trail
Record Retention: All documentation, including the initial access list, the formal manager confirmation emails, and the final access removal requests (ServiceNow tickets), are retained as the official audit trail for the bi-annual attestation cycle.

Completion: The process is officially closed, providing assurance that network drive access remains appropriate and consistent with current business needs.
