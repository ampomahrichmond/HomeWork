"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. I’m excited to share the progress we’ve made in transforming how we manage and scale enterprise data through EDM Tooling—specifically Collibra and EDC. Let’s walk through some key updates that reflect the momentum we’re building."

1. 🚀 Collibra Adoption and Metadata Automation
"We’re seeing increased functionality and user adoption of Collibra. This quarter, we’ve successfully automated the ingestion of critical metadata and reference data using our DSCII and RDCT templates. These are foundational for scalable metadata management."

2. 📊 Progress in CDE Coverage
"We’ve staged over 3,200 Critical Data Elements across 25 tier-1 reports. That’s a huge step forward in defining and rationalizing the data we rely on most. This level of transparency is what drives trust and accountability in enterprise reporting."

3. 🌐 Integrations for Data Quality & Controls
"We’re not just cataloging data—we’re activating it. We’re connecting more than 10 systems to perform real-time Data Quality assessments and enable regulatory controls for Treasury and Liquidity. That work is on track to deliver by late August."

4. 👥 User Enablement and Scaling
"We’ve onboarded 25 new users to manage data in Collibra, with many more in the pipeline. This isn't just a tool rollout—it’s a cultural shift. Teams are stepping into ownership of data, and that’s key for sustainability."

5. 🧩 Product Registry & Marketplace
"We’re launching a Data Product Registry in late June—yes, this month! It will empower Data Product Owners to publish certified datasets in a searchable marketplace. This is how we turn data into a business-ready product."

6. 🧹 Rationalizing Tools & Decommissioning EDC
"As we streamline, we’ve started the decommissioning of EDC. The first step is surveying users and migrating core content into Collibra, targeting late August. EDC will sunset by late 2026, freeing us from tool sprawl."

7. 🛠️ Foundational Projects Underway
"Several foundational efforts are running in parallel: Unity Catalog, Cyber-Ark, DIAMOND onboarding, and user access governance via ServiceNow. These are the ‘pipes and plumbing’ behind secure and governed data."

8. ✅ Change Management & EDC Migration
"Training for stakeholder groups is underway, and new user lists are being finalized. Meanwhile, EDC’s technical migration to VMware Cloud (VMC2) is wrapping up, with testing complete and PAT installations beginning."

🔚 Closing Line (15 seconds):
"Across metadata, governance, and infrastructure, we’re not just improving tools—we’re building a more connected, accountable, and scalable data ecosystem. Thank you!"
